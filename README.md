### Hi! 😁 

My name is Pedro Paulo Carvalho from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work as an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) intern at [Neon](https://neon.com.br/), I study computer science. I'm entering the world of programming. I am currently studying Python.

In my free time I like to play basketball (🏀), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺) and to listen to music (🎵).

Would you like to find me?
